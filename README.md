# RetroOrganizzer

!!!!In early development!!!

Retrogame repository organizer.

Building with .NET MAUI

The main function of the App:
  - Helps organize the gamelist.xml with editing, cleaning xml nodes that are no longer exists in the folder
  - Bin to chd conversion
  - Integrate with screenscraper (if the French guy lets you)
  - sync with micro SD card
  - etc.

Layout is still a mess, I'll adjust it over time
